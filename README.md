A small project to draw molecules from .pdb files (file examples are available in the project).
The program does not depend on additional libraries, all dependencies are already included.
Works only on Visual Studio platform. Attempting to build for Linux leads to headaches.

There is a small issue related to vertex selection, related to paralax.

You can see what it looks like in example.png
